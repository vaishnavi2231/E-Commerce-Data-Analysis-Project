# E-Commerce-Data-Analysis-Project

The Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist is a real-world dataset from the Olist marketplace in Brazil. It records over 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018, including detailed information about customers, sellers, products, payments, deliveries, and reviews.


The dataset consists of multiple interconnected CSV files — such as orders, customers, sellers, order_items, payments, products, and reviews — enabling end-to-end analysis of the order journey: from purchase and payment to delivery and customer feedback.
